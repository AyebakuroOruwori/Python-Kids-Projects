#Let's use string comparisons to label data acquired through a fitness app's user survey
#We'll chech the users' survey answers regarding activity frquency and intensity, label them, and display the result.

#The current user does sports once a week, so create a FREQUENCY variable set to "once a week"
frequency = "once a week"

#Next save the user's answers regarding sports INTENSITY variable set to"low"
intensity = "low"

#Create the variable HIGHLY_ACTIVE to save the result of the comparsion. To label a user as highly active, we need to check if FREQUENCY equals "daily"
highly_active = frequency == "daily"

#Next, display "Highly active user:" in the console.
print("Highly active user:")

#Finally, display the value of HIGHLY_ACTIVE
print(highly_active)

#Create the variable HIGH_INTENSITY to save the result of the comparison. To label the user as doing high-intensity sports, check if the variable INTENSITY equals high 
high_intensity = intensity == "high"

#Next, display "High intensity sports:" in the console.
print("High intesity sports:")

#Finnally, display the value of the HIGH_INTENSITY variable.
print(high_intensity)



#Good Job
