#Have you ever tried to convert miles into kilometers of the other way around? Spoiler alert: it's tough.

#We'll make it easier by building a converter app to solve this problem for good.



#Start by picking the variable name for the miles and give it an initial value of 500.

miles = 500

#Create a kilometers variable and give it the vakue of miles.

kilometers = miles

#A mile is about 1.609344 kilometers. Let's transform miles into kilometer by multiplying the number of the miles by that number.
#Update kilometers by multiplying miles by 1.609344.


kilometers = miles * 1.609344

#Now it's time to display the converted distance in the console.
#Use print to display the value of kilometers.

print(kilometers)

#Yay this is the app that converts miles into  kilometers. Gone are the days of confusion.
