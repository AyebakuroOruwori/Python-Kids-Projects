#Now let's simulate what happens during the night. Temporarily set IS_DAY to False.
is_day = False

#When it's not daytime, the lights should be on, so use NOT to update LIGHTS_ON to the opposite of IS_DAY.
lights_on = not is_day

#Now use print() to display DAYTIME? in the console.
print("Daytime?")

#Display the value of the IS_DAY variable in the console.
print(is_day)

#Time to check on the status of the light! Start by displaying LIGHTS ON?
print("Lights on?")

#Next, display the value of the lights_on variable.
print(lights_on)

#There you have it! We've written some code that checks if  it's daytime or nighttime and switches the lights on and off  accordigly.
