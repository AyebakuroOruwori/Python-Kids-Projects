#Let's use our knowledge of number equality to write code that tracks sales data for an online jeans retailer.
#We'll compare jeans_sold with TARGET to see if the retailer hit their sales target. Then we'll check if there are jeans still in stock.


#Code a STOCK variable that stores 600, followed by JEANS_SOLD and TARGET variables that both store 500.
stock = 600
jeans_sold = 500
target = 500

#To see if the sales target was achieved,check if JEAN_SOLD has the same value as TARGET with ==, Next, create the variable target_hit to store the results of the comparison.
target_hit = jeans_sold == target

#Display "Hit jeans sale target:"
print("Hit jeans sale target: ")

#Finally, use print to display the value of the target_hit variable
print(target_hit)

#Create current_stock to keep track of the remaining stock.
#Subtract jeans_sold  from stock and store the value into current_stock.
current_stock = stock - jeans_sold


#To check if jeans are still in stock, make sure that current_stock not equal to 0, check up on the stock anything by storing the comparsion into the variable IN_STOCK.
in_stock = current_stock != 0


#Finally, display "Jeans in stock", and then on the next line the value of IN_STOCK. 
print("Jeans in stock:")
print(in_stock)
